# TeaTimer
This is a simple yet elegant tea timer that will allow you to properly time your brews every time! You can build one yourself with the components listed in the BOM, and then upload the Arduino code in the "TeaTimer_Main_V1" folder to make it work. If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print an enclosure using the files in the "3DPrintFiles" folder  to make it easy to assemble and look more polished.

Of course this is all up for interpretation! Please take this project and modify it and make it everything you want it to be. The simplest modification would be simply to purchase a smaller, cheaper battery. You could easily knock $10 off the price, make it smaller, and it will work just as well.

For what it's worth though, I will provide documentation on how I built mine in case you want a good a good place to start.
