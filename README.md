# TeaTimer

This is a simple yet elegant tea timer that will allow you to properly time your brews every time! You can build one yourself with the components listed in the BOM, and then upload the Arduino code in the "TeaTimer_Main_V1" folder to make it work. If you have access to a 3D printer, you can print an enclosure using the files in the "3DPrintFiles" folder  to make it easy to assemble and look more polished.

Of course this is all up for interpretation! Please take this project and modify it and make it everything you want it to be. The simplest modification would be simply to purchase a smaller, cheaper battery. You could easily knock $10 off the price, make it smaller, and it will work just as well.

For what it's worth though, I will provide documentation on how I built mine in case you want a good a good place to start.

# Build your own!
This project is a great way to get your feet wet in DIY product making. It requires only basic knowledge of Arduino, breadboarding, soldering, and optional 3D Printing.

### Acquire the Parts
The version I built cost around $60 in parts. All of the components can be purchased on Adafruit.com 

Here's the parts list (aka BOM or Bill of Materials) with links and descriptions of everything you'll need to create your very own Tea Timer V1
[BOM-aka-parts_list.csv](https://github.com/EfficiencyJunky/TeaTimerV1/blob/master/BOM-aka-parts_list.csv "BOM-aka-parts_list.csv")

Once you have the parts, you will need to do a little bit of Soldering to get them all prepped to plug and play.
