# TeaTimer
This is a simple yet elegant tea timer that will allow you to properly time your brews every time! You can build with the components listed in the BOM, upload the Arduino code in the "TeaTimer_Main_V1" folder, and 3D print an enclosure using the files in the "3DPrintFiles" folder for it to make it look nice.
